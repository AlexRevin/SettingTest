== SettingTest demo

This code was written in order to complete the following test task:

Write a model (ActiveRecord-based) for storing global configuration settings. It will be used for storing single values, for example an email address to send error emails to, or a flag enable/disable a particular feature. The interface must be simple and convenient, - it should be possible to read and write specific configuration items. It must be possible to store values of these 4 types: string, integer, float and boolean. The model should come with a unit test and a migration.

Bonus: add caching within the model so that values are cached in regular Rails cache to minimize db load.


== Description
The idea of storing and accessing the data was taken from the rails-setting plugin located at http://github.com/Squeegy/rails-settings
It uses the method_missing in order to create dynamic attributes and stores serialized data in the DB

== Testing
You can test the codebase with RSpec tests by running
#   rake spec RAILS_ENV='test'
